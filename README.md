# Auth Service

Is a simple service that allows to register and login a user.
At the registration time a user can choose to enable the 2FA (property `two_factor_auth_enabled`). 

If a user has the 2FA disabled the `/login` endpoint returns the following json:
```sh
{
    "token":"a JWT token"
}
```
If the 2FA is enabled the response will be:
```sh
{
    "session_id":"session_id"
}
```
and an OTP will be send (now it's logged).
With the `session_id` and the `OTP` it's possible to get the JWT token calling the `/otp-token`.

The endpoint documentation is under

### Install
- clone the repo and cd into
- active a compatible python version `pyenv local 3.9.5`
- install the repo with all its dependencies: `make install`

### Run test
```
make test
```
### Run unit test
